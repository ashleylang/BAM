Supporting data and code for: Jevon and Lang, 2021; Tree biomass allocation differs by mycorrhizal association

This analysis was made possible by the BAAD (Biomass And Allometry Database) for woody plants (Falster, et al. 2015, Ecology)
FR_occurrences.csv and FR_measurements.csv are data files from the FungalRoot database (Soudzilovskaia, et al. 2020, New Phytologist)
The folder wc10 contains WorldClim data used in the analysis.

The file biomass_allocation.R contains the code required to download the BAAD, FungalRoot, and WorldClim data used in this study, as well as the code to generate all figures and linear models used in this analysis.

Figures 1 and 2 and Supplementary Table 1 from the published manuscript are available to view as separate files.
